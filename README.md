# rando utils

This repository holds source code for some small utility programs I've written
to help with various tasks. Typically I use shell or python scripts, and those
can be found in [my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/randoragon/dotfiles), but
sometimes I want to write something in C or some other compiled language, and in
those cases dotfiles will only have the executable, while the source code will
reside here.

Note that programs in this repo were mostly (or exclusively) intended for my use
and my use only, so while you may do whatever you want with them
(see [LICENSE](https://github.com/randoragon/randoutils/blob/master/LICENSE)),
I don't bother myself with keeping them well documented, you're on your own.
