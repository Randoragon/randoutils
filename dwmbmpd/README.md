# dwmbmpd - an MPD module for dwmblocks

A super refined status module for MPD, displaying pause/play/stop icons, elapsed time,
duration, artist, title and everything is underlined with a beautiful progress bar.
If either the artist of the title are longer than specified, an ellipsis is put instead.

If you need variable width font support, try
[commit 2003997](https://github.com/Randoragon/randoutils/commit/20039976245bbcf9cdd37ac8ca4c19128bcb1904)
and before. As of
[b1677c0](https://github.com/Randoragon/randoutils/commit/b1677c0b2bb53d7e8be83fb9a4b1badacb56f6be),
I've removed variable width font
support, because it was rather poorly written and I've been using exclusively monospace fonts
for my status bar anyway, so I didn't want the unnecessary overhead.

There is full Unicode support for calculating lengths of artist names/song titles and
truncating them with an "â€¦" ellipsis. Specifics can be adjusted to one's liking with a few
macro definitions placed at the top of the main source file.

## Required dwm patches

- [status2d](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/status2d/)
    - If you don't want the progress bar or the colored font you could edit the code and make it work without this patch
